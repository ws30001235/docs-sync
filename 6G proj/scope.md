## scope

#### 28.100 

The present document specifies the concepts for **autonomous networks**, autonomous network level, and that use cases , requirements and solutions for the levels of autonomous functions in a 3GPP network.

#### 28.104

The present document specifies the MDA capabilities with corresponding analytics inputs and analytics outputs (reports), as well as processes and requirements for MDAS (**Management Data Analytics Service**), historical data handling for MDA, and ML support for MDA.

This document also describes the MDA functionality and service framework, and MDA role in the management loop.

#### 28.105

The present document specifies the Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning **(AI/ML) management capabilities** and services for 5GS where AI/ML is used, including management and orchestration (e.g., MDA, see TS 28.104 [2]) and 5G networks (e.g., NWDAF, see TS 23.288 [3]).

This document also describes the functionality and service framework for AI/ML management.

#### 28.201

The present document is part of a series of documents that specify **charging aspects of network slicing**. 

The present document includes the charging aspects of network slice performance and analytics, including charging scenarios, data and way of data transfer specific for the network slice. 

The architecture for network slice charging follows common architecture and concepts specified in TS 32.240 [1]. 

The charging aspect of network slice charging on PDU session charging is specified in TS 32.255 [15].

The network slice performance and analytics charging collects and processes charging information related to performance metrics of a network slice. 

#### 28.202

The present document specifies the Converged Charging description for **network slice management charging** in the 5G System (5GS). The present document specifies the charging aspects for management of network slicing in mobile networks.

#### 28.301

The present document specifies the requirements of the Licensed Shared Access (LSA) Controller (LC) Integration Reference Point (IRP). This IRP allows the NM to interact with the LC. This interaction with the LC enables the NM to configure NEs utilizing LSA spectrum resources.

The following two deployment scenarios are supported:

\-  one scenario in which the LC communicates LSA spectrum resource availability information to the NM, and

\-  one scenario in which the LC determines and communicates to the NM constraints on parameters of cells liable to use LSA spectrum resources.
